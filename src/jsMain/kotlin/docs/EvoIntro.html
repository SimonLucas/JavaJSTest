    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        Natural evolution underlies the amazing diversity and
        complexity of life on earth. This has led researchers since the dawn of
        computer science and AI to try to capture the essence of these natural processes in
        evolutionary algorithms (EA). While EAs have been the subject of much research
        for more than six decades, the essential parts of an EA are
        surprisingly simple and powerful. Even the most basic versions provide a
        useful and often competitive benchmark across a range of problems.
    </p>

    <p>
        The aim of this short article is to explain and demonstrate the key elements of
        an EA via a set of interactive elements embedded in this page. As you read through
        the article you can play with these to better understand them. The key elements are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Initialisation</li>
        <li>Copying and Variation</li>
        <li>Evaluation</li>
        <li>Selection</li>
    </ul>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="./JavaJSTest.js"></script>

    <h2>Initialisation</h2>

    <h2>Copying and Variation</h2>

    <p>
        A simple and effective type of variation operator is mutation.
        There are many types of mutation operator, but here
        we're going to use a very simple one.  This will consider each
        element of an individual in turn, randomly changing each one with a specified
        probability, which you'll get to choose.  In other words,
        we'll run along the vector of bits, flipping each one
        on the toss of a biased coin.
    </p>




    <h2>Evaluation</h2>

    <p>

        An evaluation method is required in order to inform the decision
        of which individual(s) to select for "breeding".
        There are three types of evaluation commonly used, plus a
        fourth that's kind of exciting but I suggest rarely used.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Absolute</li>
        <li>Relative</li>
        <li>Interactive</li>
        <li>In the wild</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <em>Absolute</em> involves an objective measurement of an individual such as speed,
        weight or height.  The measurement will in no way depend on other individuals
        in the population.  However, the selection process will still make comparisons
        with other individuals, but this does not affect the measurements.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Relative</em> is when each measurement is an outcome
        of an interaction between at least two individuals in the
        population.  For example, we can evaluate the fitness
        of a set of chess playing algorithms by playing them against each other
        and measuring the points (wins and draws) each one obtains.
        The relative method has the great benefit of enabling
        the open-ended evolution of systems with ever-increasing intelligence.
    </p>

    <p><em>Interactive</em> uses a human to select the best individual(s)
    at each iteration of the algorithm.  This can be labour intensive
    but sometimes leads to very interesting results that would
    be difficult to obtain by other means.</p>

    <p><em>In the wild</em> is where the evolved solutions compete
    for survival in some real-world process: financial trading being
        an obvious possibility.  Here, evolved algorithmic traders
        operate in real-world financial markets, with survival being dependent
        on their ability to prosper.  Like the relative method,
        this can also lead to ever-increasing intelligence, where
        algrorithms can obtain a competitive advantage by processing
        more data streams (news, social media, financial tick data)
        in cleverer ways.  It's not clear whether this is used much
        in practice, at least in its purest form, but has been the subject of
        some interesting fiction including <dt-cite key="FearIndex">The Fear Index</dt-cite>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course in a very broad sense
        many aspects of product design have strong evolutionary
        aspects where the best traits make it through into future
        products (think phones, cars), but there are many other
        factors involved also.
    </p>


    <h2>Selection</h2>

    <p>
        Having evaluated the individuals in our population, we then
        select which ones to copy and vary for our next generation.
        In the interests of keeping it simple, we're going to select
        the best each time (also called elitist selection), with
        the subtle twist of preferring the newer one if two candidates
        have equal fitness.  This avoids getting stuck in areas of
        the search space where the fitness landscape is flat.
    </p>

    <h2>Evolution</h2>

    <p>Have covered the essentials, we're now ready to evolve stuff!</p>
