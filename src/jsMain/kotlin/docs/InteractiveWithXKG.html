        Journals such as Distill publish high quality interactive articles, and
        an extensive gallery of these can be found in Hohman et al <dt-cite key="hohman2020"></dt-cite>,
        who also describe the barriers to producing interactive articles. Writing an interactive
        article is much more time-consuming than authoring a traditional static
        article, and also requires a wider skillset.

    </p>

    <p>

        This paper gives a short tutorial on how to code the interactive elements in
        the Kotlin language.  Kotlin is a modern high-level language with a number
        of desirable features, such as strong protection against null-pointer exceptions,
        and data classes that significantly reduce the need for boilerplate code
        compared to C++ and Java.

    </p>

    <p>
        When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
        \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]
    </p>


    <p>
        In any EA we need to define the following:
    <ul>
        <li>A way to represent solutions. For example, a vector of numbers.</li>
        <li>A way to copy and vary a solution. For example, copy a vector numbers, but randomly change some in the
            copying process.
        </li>
        <li>A way to evaluate the value (fitness) of a solution.
            This can be defined in absolute terms (e.g. how fast can it move?) or
            in relative terms (can solution A beat solution B in football?).
        </li>

        <li></li>

    </ul>
