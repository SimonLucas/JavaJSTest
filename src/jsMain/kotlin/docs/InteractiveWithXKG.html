    <h2>Introduction</h2>


    <div>
        <p>

            Journals such as Distill publish high quality interactive articles, and
            an extensive gallery of these can be found in Hohman et al
            <dt-cite key="hohman2020"></dt-cite>
            who discuss the potential advantages of such articles and the significant
            barriers to producing them. Writing an interactive
            article is much more time-consuming than authoring a traditional static
            article, and also requires a wider skillset.

        </p>

        <p>
            The aim of this short article is to demonstrate a new way to
            add elements to interactive web articles, where the elements
            (called XApps, where the X is for cross platform) are authored
            in Kotlin.  This can has significant advantages when developing
            potentially complex applications, compared to authoring directly
            in JavaScript or JavaScript libraries.  Note that there are already
            amazing interactive examples using JavaScript directly, or other
            alternatives such as Processing for JavaScript.  The examples in
            this article will be underwhelming compared to many of those.
            However, when designing interactive apps with complex underlying
            algorithms, the XKG approach offers distinct advantages.  XKG
            is especially well-suited to demonstrating games and game AI,
            and supports full-screen mode to offer a more immersive experience -
            see example below.

        This paper gives a short tutorial on how to code the interactive elements in
        the Kotlin language together with the XKG framwork built on top of Kotlin.
        Kotlin is a modern high-level language with many
        desirable features, such as strong protection against null-pointer exceptions,
        and data classes that significantly reduce the need for boilerplate code
        compared to C++ and Java. By default Kotlin programs run on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
        and Kotlin code seamlessly interoperates with Java code. When run on the JVM
        the speed of Kotlin programs is similar to Java and C++.

    </p>
    <p>
        Important for the current task, Kotlin code
        can be transpiled into JavaScript to run in the browser. While this
        is great, there are some key limitations: only pure Kotlin code can be
        used, which means that any programs that use Java libraries cannot be used
        in this way. By default, the GUI aspects of an application still have to be written
        differently depending on whether the target platform is JVM or Browser,
        which is a significant limitation.

    </p>

    <p>
        In order to address this, Lucas
        <dt-cite key="LucasXKGDemo"></dt-cite>
        introduced a framework for
        developing cross-platform applications using Kotlin that run without
        any modification on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for the best speed
        (and in some respects the best convenience),
        or in a Web Browser for ease of deployment and maximum cross-platform use.

        Authors not wishing to have this cross platform (Browser + JVM) facility
        could program in pure Kotlin using the
        <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/javascript/kotlin-to-javascript/kotlin-to-javascript.html">JavaScript
            interop classes</a> for
        Web Browser interactions.
        A version of Breakout that uses this approach can be played
        <a href="https://github.com/SimonLucas/KotlinGamesJS">here</a>.
        This article will use the XKG approach, covering the following:

    <ul>
        <li>Hello world: drawing a blank canvas</li>
        <li>Drawing geometric objects and text</li>
        <li>Handling events</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Note: this article will not cover setting up a cross platform software project: doing this
        will depend on the IDE you're using, and changes depending on the version of the
        IDE and the build system you're using (e.g. Gradle or Maven). IntelliJ IDEA is
        a good IDE to use, it has Kotlin support built in.

    </p>

    <h2>Hello XApp World</h2>


    <p>

        Let's start with the easy and fun stuff. Each application implements the
        <tt>XApp</tt> interface. Apps implementing this interface should be able to run on a JVM or in a browser.

        <!--            @formatter:off-->
        <dt-code block language="javascript">
            interface XApp {
                fun paint(xg: XGraphics) {}
                fun handleMouseEvent(e: XMouseEvent) {}
                fun handleKeyEvent(e: XKeyEvent) {}
            }
        </dt-code>
        <!--            @formatter:on-->

        Each method has a default dummy implementation specified by the empty curly braces: <tt>{}</tt>.
        This means we don't have to provide empty implementations of the methods when defining applications
        that don't use them (e.g. no need to implement <tt>handleKeyEvent</tt> if the application
        does not use keyboard input).
    </p>

    <p>

        To produce output we need to implement the <tt>paint</tt> method. This takes
        a single parameter: an <tt>XGraphics</tt> object. This provides
        access to the size of the canvas and enables drawing:

        <!--            @formatter:off-->
        <dt-code block language="javascript">
            interface XGraphics {
                fun draw(toDraw: Drawable)
                var style: XStyle
                fun width(): Double
                fun height(): Double
                fun centre() = Vec2d(width() / 2, height() / 2)
                ...
            }
        </dt-code>
        <!--            @formatter:on-->

        The <tt>draw</tt> method draws any <tt>Drawable</tt> item onto the screen; each <tt>Drawable</tt>
        knows it's own location and size. When setting up items to draw we need to know
        the size of the drawing area, given by width and height; the centre is also provided
        as a convenience. The style variable defines the current drawing style, including the
        width of strokes and the colours to use for filling and stroking shapes.

    </p>


    <p>
        We're ready to write our first XKG App - the Hello World equivalent.
        Rather than drip-feeding each item, we'll dive in and do several
        things with this program:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Paint a rectangle using the default style.</li>
        <li>Display a count of the number of times the <tt>paint</tt> method has been calleld.</li>
        <li>Reset the counter whenever the canvas is clicked.</li>
    </ul>


    <!--            @formatter:off-->
    <dt-code block language="javascript">
        class HelloXKG : XApp {
            var n = 0

            override fun paint(xg: XGraphics) {
                // draw a rectangle using default style
                // centered in the canvas, and half the width and height
                xg.draw(XRect(xg.centre(), xg.width()/2, xg.height()/2))
                val text = XText("nRepaints: ${n++}", xg.centre(),
                                 TStyle(fg=XColor.yellow), XStyle())
                xg.draw(text)
            }

            override fun handleMouseEvent(e: XMouseEvent) {
                // ignore the event details, just reset the counter
                n = 0
            }
        }
    </dt-code>
    <!--            @formatter:on-->

    <p>
        Assuming you're reading this in a Web Browser, this app will
        be running right here.
    </p>

    <p>
        <canvas id="bodyCanvas" width="400" height="200"
                style="border:5px solid #009999;">
        </canvas>
    </p>

    <script>
       new JavaJSTest.sample.XAppLauncher("bodyCanvas", "HelloXKG").run();
    </script>

    <p>
        <canvas id="caveCanvas" width="500" height="350"
                style="border:5px solid #009999;">
        </canvas>
    </p>

    <script>
       new JavaJSTest.sample.XAppLauncher("caveCanvas", "CaveSwing", 20).run();
    </script>


    <h2>Embedding XApps in Web Pages</h2>

    <p>

        So far we've seen how to write XKG Apps, but we still need to run them in
        a web browser. This involves loading the JavaScript code, creating
        a canvas for each XApp, hooking up events, and calling the <code>paint</code> method
        of the XApp at the right times. This can either be done based on user-driven
        events, or at regular intervals by setting timers.

    </p>

    <p>

        By default, the JavaScript code will be in two files. The JavaScript Kotlin library
        code will be in <code>kotlin.js</code>. This is the same for any project, though there
        are different versions of the library: my advice is to use the most recent stable version.

        <dt-fn>
            Currently much of the Kotlin/JS code is in Alpha release, and while it works fine
            there is no guarantee that future versions will be backwards compatible. I recently had
            a project break when upgrading to the latest version of Intellij, as the W3C Dom
            support in Kotlin migrated from the <code>kotlin.*</code> package to <code>kotlinx.*</code>.
        </dt-fn>
    </p>

    <p>

        The second JavaScript file to load is the project specific file. This is the same
        for an entire project, and by default will be called <code>ProjectName.js</code>.
        This has a single main executable per project, which is run one each time
        an HTML the page is loaded that loads <code>ProjectName.js</code>.
        Typically we'd like to have many different XApps per project, so
        instead of launching them from the main project JavaScript file,
        we'll launch them directly where each one is used. In this way
        we can have multiple HTML files, each with multiple XApps (some of which
        may launch different instances of the same XApp).
    </p>

    <p>
        Since each XApp needs its own <code>Canvas</code> object to draw on, we embed
        these directly in the HTML, giving full control of their location and size.
        This method is ideal for articles like the current one, where we need author
        control of where the XApps should be displayed. It is also possible to
        control this using Kotlin or JavaScript code, by writing elements into the
        page's Document Object Model (DOM). The example below inserts a Canvas directly into
        the HTML.
    </p>

    <p>

        <!--            @formatter:off-->
        <dt-code block language="html">
            <canvas id="bodyCanvas" width="400" height="200"
                    style="border:5px solid #009999;">
            </canvas>
        </dt-code>
        <!--            @formatter:on-->


    </p>


    <p>We're nearly there: the only other thing to arrange is how to ensure that
        each Canvas is connected with the correct XApp. In the HTML version this is straightforward:
        we give each Canvas a unique <tt>id</tt> attribute (this should be unique across the project,
        not just across the web page), then pass the <tt>id</tt> to a dispatcher in the project script;
        this is called <tt>XAppLauncher</tt>.
        I like to place the script just after the canvas element: keeping them together
        makes it easy to keep track of, and to copy and paste into new documents as required.
    </p>

    <p>
        <!--            @formatter:off-->
        <dt-code block language="html">
                new JavaJSTest.sample.XAppLauncher("bodyCanvas", "HelloXKG").run();
        </dt-code>
        <!--            @formatter:on-->

    </p>

    <p>

        The <tt>XAppLauncher</tt> class uses a Hashmap
        to looks up the type of XApp to launch given the specified name of the app,
        in this case <em>HelloXKG</em>. It is also possible to specify the app's refresh
        rate i.e. the number of times per secod it's paint method is called; this defaults to 10 times per second
        (i.e. a timer is set to update every 100ms).

    </p>


    <h2>Enabling Full Screen Mode</h2>

    <p>
        For many articles it's desirable to have the interactive elements positioned and sized
        under author control, but in some cases we'd also like to switch elements
        to full-screen mode, which is often ideal for games and videos.
        In order to make this work across all modern browsers it's best to use
        a library, and here we use: <a href="https://fscreen.rafgraph.dev">https://fscreen.rafgraph.dev</a>.
        Here we wish to control each element going full screen.
        There are a couple of tricks needed in order to do this well.
        The easiest approach is to simply take an element into full mode using
        the library, but if done directly it will just scale up a low-res
        canvas to full screen size, causing it to appear blurry.
    </p>

    <p>
        To avoid this, we need to track "fullscreen" events, and alter the canvas size accordingly.
        And to enable all this we need to load the fullscreen library, which is compiled into
        the file <tt>bundle.js</tt>. The JavaScript needed is shown below.
    </p>

    <h4>Load the fullscreen library:</h4>

    <p>

<!--        <script src="./bundle.js"></script>-->
    </dt-code>
    <!--            @formatter:on-->
    </p>

    <h4>JavaScript to control canvas resizing:</h4>
    <!--            @formatter:off-->
    <dt-code block language="javascript">
        <script>

<!--  new JavaJSTest.sample.XAppLauncher("treeRectCanvas", "TreeRect").run();-->

        function successCallback() {
            var canvas = document.getElementById("treeRectCanvas")
            canvas.width=window.innerWidth;
            canvas.height=window.innerHeight;
            canvas.onfullscreenchange = handleFullscreenChange;
            console.log("Success");
        }

        function handleFullscreenChange(event) {
            console.log("Fullscreen change event");
            console.log(event)
            var docel = document.fullscreenElement;
            var elem = event.target;

            if (docel === null) {
                console.log("Shrinking canvas");
                elem.width = 250;
                elem.height = 150;
            } else {
                console.log("NOT shrinking canvas");
            }
        }


        function failureCallback() {
            console.log("Failure!");
        }

        function fullScreenRect() {
            console.log("Requesting full screen");
            const promise = document.getElementById("treeRectCanvas").requestFullscreen();
