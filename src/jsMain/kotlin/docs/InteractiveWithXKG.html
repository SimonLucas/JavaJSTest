        Journals such as Distill publish high quality interactive articles, and
        an extensive gallery of these can be found in Hohman et al
        <dt-cite key="hohman2020"></dt-cite>
        ,
        who discuss the potential advantages of such articles and the significant
        barriers to producing them. Writing an interactive
        article is much more time-consuming than authoring a traditional static
        article, and also requires a wider skillset.

        This paper gives a short tutorial on how to code the interactive elements in
        the Kotlin language together with the XKG framwork built on top of Kotlin.
        Kotlin is a modern high-level language with many
        desirable features, such as strong protection against null-pointer exceptions,
        and data classes that significantly reduce the need for boilerplate code
        compared to C++ and Java. By default Kotlin programs run on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
        and Kotlin code seamlessly interoperates with Java code. When run on the JVM
        the speed of Kotlin programs is similar to Java and C++.

    </p>
    <p>
        Important for the current task, Kotlin code
        can be transpiled into JavaScript to run in the browser. While this
        is great, there are some key limitations: only pure Kotlin code can be
        used, which means that any programs that use Java libraries cannot be used
        in this way. By default, the GUI aspects of an application still have to be written
        differently depending on whether the target platform is JVM or Browser,
        which is a significant limitation.

    </p>

    <p>
        In order to address this, Lucas
        <dt-cite key="LucasXKGDemo"></dt-cite>
        introduced a framework for
        developing cross-platform applications using Kotlin that run without
        any modification on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for the best speed
        (and in some respects the best convenience),
        or in a Web Browser for ease of deployment and maximum cross-platform use.

        Authors not wishing to have this cross platform (Browser + JVM) facility
        could program in pure Kotlin using the
        <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/javascript/kotlin-to-javascript/kotlin-to-javascript.html">JavaScript
            interop classes</a> for
        Web Browser interactions.
        A version of Breakout that uses this approach can be played
        <a href="https://github.com/SimonLucas/KotlinGamesJS">here</a>.
        This article will use the XKG approach, covering the following:

    <ul>
        <li>Hello world: drawing a blank canvas</li>
        <li>Drawing geometric objects and text</li>
        <li>Handling events</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Note: this article will not cover setting up a cross platform software project: doing this
        will depend on the IDE you're using, and changes depending on the version of the
        IDE and the build system you're using (e.g. Gradle or Maven). IntelliJ IDEA is
        a good IDE to use, it has Kotlin support built in.

    </p>

    <h2>Hello World</h2>


    <p>

        Let's start with the easy and fun stuff. Each application implements the
        <tt>XApp</tt> interface:

        <dt-code block language="javascript">
            interface XApp {
            fun paint(xg: XGraphics) {}
            fun handleMouseEvent(e: XMouseEvent) {}
            fun handleKeyEvent(e: XKeyEvent) {}
            }
        </dt-code>

        Each method has a default dummy implementation specified by the empty curly braces: <tt>{}</tt>.
        This means we don't have to provide empty implementations of the methods when defining applications
        that don't use them (e.g. no need to implement <tt>handleKeyEvent</tt> if the application
        does not use keyboard input).
    </p>

    <p>

        To produce output we need to implement the <tt>paint</tt> method. This takes
        a single parameter: an <tt>XGraphics</tt> object. This provides
        access to the size of the canvas and enables drawing:

        <dt-code block language="javascript">
            interface XGraphics {
            fun draw(toDraw: Drawable)
            var style: XStyle
            fun width(): Double
            fun height(): Double
            fun centre() = Vec2d(width() / 2, height() / 2)
            ...
            }
        </dt-code>

        The <tt>draw</tt> method draws any <tt>Drawable</tt> item onto the screen; each <tt>Drawable</tt>
        knows it's own location and size. When setting up items to draw we need to know
        the size of the drawing area, given by width and height; the centre is also provided
        as a convenience. The style variable defines the current drawing style, including the
        width of strokes and the colours to use for filling and stroking shapes.

    </p>

    <p>
        We're ready to write our first XKG App - the Hello World equivalent.
        Rather than drip-feeding each item, we'll dive in and do several
        things with this program:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Paint a rectangle using the default style.</li>
        <li>Display a count of the number of times the <tt>paint</tt> method has been calleld.</li>
        <li>Reset the counter whenever the canvas is clicked.</li>
    </ul>


    <dt-code block language="javascript">
        class HelloXKG : XApp {
        var n = 0

        override fun paint(xg: XGraphics) {
        // draw a rectangle using default style
        // centered in the canvas, and half the width and height
        xg.draw(XRect(xg.centre(), xg.width()/2, xg.height()/2))

        val text = XText("nRepaints: ${n++}",
        xg.centre(), TStyle(fg=XColor.yellow), XStyle())
        xg.draw(text)
        }

        override fun handleMouseEvent(e: XMouseEvent) {
        // ignore the event details, just reset the counter
        n = 0
        }
        }
    </dt-code>

    <p>
        Assuming you're reading this in a Web Browser, this app will
        be running right here.
    </p>

    <p>
        <canvas id="bodyCanvas" width="400" height="200"
                style="border:5px solid #009999;">
        </canvas>
    </p>

    <p>
        Connecting a Canvas element to an XApp is straightforward (when you know how!),
        and can be done in a number of ways. Here we'll use a convenience XKG
        class called the <tt>XAppLauncher</tt>. To call this we give it the name
        of the XApp class.

    </p>

    <script>

  new JavaJSTest.sample.XAppLauncher("bodyCanvas").run();


    </script>

<dt-appendix>
    <h2>Appendix: Embedding XKG Apps in Web Pages</h2>


    <p>

        So far we've seen how to write XKG Apps, but we still need to run them in
        a web browser. This involves loading the JavaScript code, creating
        a canvas for each XApp, hooking up events, and calling the <code>paint</code> method
        of the XApp at the right times. This can either be done based on user-driven
        events, or at regular intervals by setting timers.

    </p>

    <p>

        By default, the JavaScript code will be in two files. The JS for Kotlin library
        code will be in <code>kotlin.js</code>. This is the same for any project, though there
        are different versions: my advice is to use the most recent stable version. Currently
        much of the Kotlin/JS code is in Alpha release, and while it works fine
        there is no guarantee that future versions will be backwards compatible. I recently had
        a project break when upgrading to the latest version of Intellij, as the W3C Dom
        support in Kotlin migrated from the <code>kotlin.*</code> package to <code>kotlinx.*</code>.

    </p>

    <p>

        The second JS file to load is the project specific file. This is the same
        for an entire project, and by default will be called <code>ProjectName.js</code>.
        Having one main executable per project is a bit of a pain, as normally one
        would like to have many runnable programs per project. Not a major
        problem though, and easy to program our way around it.

    </p>

    <p>
        What we're aiming for is to have a project with multiple HTML web pages, each running
        different XApps, and some possibly running multiple XApps in the same page.
        Since each XApp needs its own <code>Canvas</code> object to draw on, there are
        two ways to created these. We can either create them when authoring the HTML
        web page (call this the <em>HTML</em> method), or we can create them when loading the
        <code>ProjectName.js</code> script (call this the <em>Script</em> method).

        The HTML method is ideal for articles like the current one, where we need author
        control of where the XApps should be displayed. The Script method might be better when
        the only purpose of the HTML page is to launch the XApp.
    </p>

    <p>We're nearly there: the only other thing to arrange is how to ensure that
        each Canvas is connected with the correct XApp. In the HTML version this is straightforward:
        we give each Canvas a unique ID attribute (this should be unique across the project,
        not just across the web page), then pass the ID to a dispatcher in the project script.</p>

    <p>In the Script version, we currently use a simple trick: look for a unique substring
        in the HTML page title, and use this to decide which XApp to connect to a dynamically created
        Canvas object.</p>


    <p>


        The steps are as follows:


    <ol>
        <li></li>

    </ol>


    </p>
