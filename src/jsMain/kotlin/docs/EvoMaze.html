    <h1>Hello World Evolved</h1>
    <h2>A simple interactive introduction to evolutionary algorithms</h2>
    <dt-byline></dt-byline>
    <p>

        Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) provide a simple yet powerful and
        general approach to many problems in AI.
        While EAs have been the subject of decades of fruitful research,
        it is also important to understand that great results can often
        be achieved with very simple EAs. In this article we'll study
        the simplest possible EA, and show how it can be applied to a design
        problem that most other AI approaches would I think struggle to solve in
        so simple a manner.

    </p>

    <p>
        When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
        \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]
    </p>


    <p>
        In any EA we need to define the following:
    <ul>
        <li>A way to represent solutions. For example, a vector of numbers.</li>
        <li>A way to copy and vary a solution. For example, copy a vector numbers, but randomly change some in the
            copying process.
        </li>
        <li>A way to evaluate the value (fitness) of a solution.
            This can be defined in absolute terms (e.g. how fast can it move?) or
            in relative terms (can solution A beat solution B in football?).
        </li>

        <li></li>

    </ul>
